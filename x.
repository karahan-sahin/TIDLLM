What is the core of the memory
Isocortex - Cerebral - Edinger
he works on mammals and birds -> larger brains 
pallium (larger in mammals) vs subpallium (larger in birds)
extreme point to point connection - extremely precise
horizontal and vertical connections
no isocortex but cluster of neurons
body big -> brain small (birds)
still compete with chimpanzes

how cognition works
piaget to magpies
they make the same mistakes, same breakthroghs
understanding the words statistically, error research levensthein distance

neural mass -> more neurons more cognitive perf.
isocortex is most advance
similar circutes similar functions

findings from conference
1. isocortex mammals - avians homologous
2. more neurons than expected
3. smarter birds have more associative neurons - more neurons thn

but how can they
